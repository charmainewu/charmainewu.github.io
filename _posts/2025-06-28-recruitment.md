## Research Focus

My research leverages large-scale human activity datasets to analyze and optimize energy and transportation systems. The methodologies and application areas are as follows.

**Methodologies**
    - Optimization (discrete, or stochastic)
    - Control Theory 
    - Machine learning and deep learning
    - Mechanism design and game theory
    - Network science and statistical physics of complex systems

**Applications**
    - Human dynamics modeling and analytics in transportation-energy systems
    - Vehicle-grid integration
    - Electric fleet operation and smart charging
    - Transportation-energy infrastructure planning
    - Smart grid management
