## Background

Electrical generation and transmission systems are generally sized to correspond to peak demand. To reduce peak demand or avoid system emergencies, we have two choices:

1. Add generation capabilities to meet the peak and occasional demand spikes

3. Add demand response (DR) program 

Among these two choices, the DR is more cost-effective. The underlying objective of DR is to actively engage customers in modifying their consumption in response to pricing signals. On the appliance lvel, services of appliances are reduced according to a preplanned load scheme during the critical time frames.  

## Research Problem
To design a pricing scheme at appliance level, we should know how users value the appliance. The research problem is: modeling the appliance level utility functions of users. To do this, we need to solve two problems:

1. Which appliance is more important to the user?

- Discrete Choice Model to estimate the value of energy.
    * Build the binary choice model. 
        - $$U_{yes} = \beta_{0}+\beta_{energy} x_{energy} + \beta_{price} x_{price} + \beta_{entropy} x_{entropy} + \beta_{temperature} x_{temperature}$$
        - $$U_{no} = 0$$
    * Willingness to pay. coefficient of energy consumption / coefficient of energy price.
        - $$WTP = \frac{\beta_{energy}}{\beta_{price}}$$
    * Value of energy. willingness to pay * maximum energy consumption  

2. For certain appliance, how the utility increases with the energy conusmption?

- Quadratic Utility Function $U = ax(b-x)$.
    * Rewrite as: $U = a'* (4/b^{2}) * x(b-x)$
    * Maximum energy consumption $b$: maximum energy consumption in past week.  
    * Scaler of the utility $a$: willness to pay for marginal increase in utility.

## Mathematics

The mathematics powered by [**MathJax**](https://www.mathjax.org/):

$$ \sum_{n=1}^\infty 1/n^2 = \frac{\pi^2}{6} $$

When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ and they are

$$ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} $$
