Energy efficiency measures, such as demand response, facilitate the transformation to jointly relieve consumers’ financial burden and improve the operability of the electric power grid, in a carbon-free way. In this paper, we design a cluster-based appliance-level-of-use demand response program, based on the massive volume of appliance consumption data, to expand the role demand response can play in the power grid’s low-carbon transition. We systematically model the appliance-level utility function to distinguish consumers’ distinct consumption patterns. We then develop a bi-level optimization model to capture the interactions between individual consumers and a distribution system operator (DSO) and enable appliance-level-of-use demand response functions. To further improve the efficiency and scalability of the proposed mechanism, we propose a cluster-based approach to capture the heterogeneity of users based on their energy consumption behaviors. Simulation results show that by capturing the detailed appliance-level response patterns, the proposed approach can systematically improve overall social welfare compared with conventional demand response mechanisms.Link for more!For more information please refer to Full Paper." }, { "title": "An Optimal Solutions-guided Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Online Energy Storage Control", "url": "/posts/drl/", "categories": "Energy Storage", "tags": "Reinforcement Learning, Optimization", "date": "2024-02-01 00:00:00 +0800", "snippet": "What’s it?As renewable energy becomes more prevalent in the power grid, energy storage systems (ESSs) are playing an ever-increasingly crucial role in mitigating short-term supply–demand imbalances. However, the operation and control of ESS are not straightforward, given the ever-changing electricity prices in the market environment and the stochastic and intermittent nature of renewable energy generations, which respond to real-time load variations. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach to address the electricity arbitrage problem associated with optimal ESS management. First, we analyze the structure of the optimal offline ESS control problem using the mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation. This formulation identifies optimal control actions to absorb excess renewable energy and perform price arbitrage strategies. To tackle the uncertainties inherent in the prediction data, we then recast the online ESS control problem into a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework and develop the DRL approach, which involves integrating the optimal offline control solution obtained from the training data into the training process and introducing noise to the state transitions. Unlike typical offline DRL training over a long time interval, we employ the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithms with smaller neural networks training over a short time interval. Numerical studies demonstrate the promising potential of the proposed DRL-enabled approach for achieving better online control performance than the model predictive control (MPC) method under different price errors. This highlights the sample efficiency and robustness of our DRL approaches in managing ESS for electricity arbitrage.Link for more!For more information please refer to Full Paper." }, { "title": "Planning Charging Stations for 2050 to Support Flexible Electric Vehicle Demand Considering Individual Mobility Patterns", "url": "/posts/supply/", "categories": "Electric Vehicle", "tags": "Performance Evaluation, Optimization", "date": "2024-01-08 00:00:00 +0800", "snippet": "What’s it?With the widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), it is crucial to plan for charging in a way that considers both EV driver behavior and the electricity grid’s demand. Here, we integrate detailed mobility data with empirical charging preferences to estimate charging demand and demonstrate the power of personalized shifting recommendations to move individual EV drivers’ demand on the grid out of peak hours. We find an unbalanced geographical distribution of charging demand in the San Francisco Bay Area, with temporal peaks in both grid off-peak hours in the morning and on-peak hours in the evening. Aligning with mobility patterns, our strategy effectively shifts demand to off-peak times. With the 2050 target of 90% EVs, this shifting reduces total on-peak charging demand by 61%, which could require over ∼18,000 additional level 3 chargers. We recommend building more charging stations and implementing shifting recommendations for EV grid integration.Link for more!For more information please refer to Full Paper." }, { "title": "Electric Vehicles Embedded Virtual Power Plants Dispatch Mechanism Design Considering Charging Efficiencies.", "url": "/posts/vpp/", "categories": "Electric Vehicle", "tags": "Demand Response, Performance Evaluation, Optimization", "date": "2023-09-01 00:00:00 +0800", "snippet": "What’s it?The increasingly popular electric vehicles (EVs) are changing the control paradigm of the power grid due to their uncoordinated charging behaviors. However, if well coordinated, smart homes, workplaces, and other locations that support EV charging could provide the grid with the urgently required flexibility via virtual power plants (VPP). In this paper, we develop the EV charging schedule model by capturing the unwillingness of EV drivers to alter their initial charging behaviors, referred to as the discomfort function. Predictability and the value of charging time, which represent the electricity consumption stability and the time value of EV drivers, characterize the discomfort function. Rather than existing works capturing discomfort by a direct simple parameter, such a computable data-driven quantification of discomfort enables us to customize an efficient VPP dispatch mechanism for EVs. In addition, to deal with the unknown charging efficiencies of EVs, we apply chance constraints only with the knowledge about mean and standard deviation of charging efficiencies, rather than their specific distribution. Using the concept of conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), we build an effective algorithm to solve the practical non-convex VPP dispatch model considering charging efficiencies. The effectiveness of our proposed models and associated algorithms are validated by numerical studies.Link for more!For more information please refer to Full Paper." }, { "title": "Deadline Differentiated Dynamic EV Charging Price Menu Design", "url": "/posts/menu/", "categories": "Electric Vehicle", "tags": "EV Charging, Price Design, Behavior Analysis", "date": "2022-07-26 00:00:00 +0800", "snippet": "What’s it?The increasing number of electric vehicles (EVs) on the road brings both opportunities and challenges to the power system. For the EV charging stations (EVCSs), it is often difficult to conduct effective operations due to the incomplete information in EVs’ departure times and the opacity of their preference information. To tackle this challenge, we seek to design the optimal deadline differentiated dynamic price menu that offers multiple choice-pairs of deadlines and charging prices. We prove that such price menus can incentivize EVs to truthfully reveal their departure time. We then analyze the properties of the optimal price menu with complete EV information, i.e., social optimality and first-degree price discrimination. For the incomplete information case, we first design a systematic method to estimate the utility and demand information for a large population of EVs based on EV behavior data. Then, we employ mixed-integer quadratic programming for the efficient optimal price menu design. The numerical study based on field data in California verifies the remarkable performance of our designed price menu.Link for more!For more information please refer to Full Paper." }, { "title": "Appliance Level Utility Function Modeling", "url": "/posts/utility/", "categories": "Smart Grid", "tags": "Discrete Choice Modeling", "date": "2022-05-01 00:00:00 +0800", "snippet": "BackgroundElectrical generation and transmission systems are generally sized to correspond to peak demand. To reduce peak demand or avoid system emergencies, we have two choices: Add generation capabilities to meet the peak and occasional demand spikes Add demand response (DR) program Among these two choices, the DR is more cost-effective. The underlying objective of DR is to actively engage customers in modifying their consumption in response to pricing signals. On the appliance level, services of appliances are reduced according to a preplanned load scheme during the critical time frames.Research ProblemTo design a pricing scheme at the appliance level, we should know how users value the appliance. The research problem is: modeling the appliance level utility functions of users. To do this, we need to solve two problems: Among all appliances, which appliance is more important to the user? For certain appliances, how does the utility increase with the energy consumption? MethodologyWe will first introduce the dataset we use and then illustrate the utility model. Data ExplorationWe use four data sources here as the independent variables for the model. Energy: average of the past week’s energy consumption associated with the appliance. An appliance like a dryer consumes more energy than other appliances and has a flatter distribution of energy consumption, while clothes washer, dishwasher, and microwave has low energy consumption.Histogram for energy consumption in a year Price: Tier price scheme according to the Austin energy department. The price increases when the accumulated energy consumption increases. The user in this case may considerably reduce the energy consumption to achieve a lower electricity bill.Tier price scheme for Austin Entropy: For each appliance, we convert energy consumption into a cumulative probability density function (CDF) and assign values to different CDF curve shapes using Shannon entropy.In detail, for each appliance and each house, we extract the appliance energy consumption. We convert these counts into a cumulative probability density function (CDF). Our intuition is that the shapes of the CDF curves present useful information about how each house uses a specific appliance. For example, sharp jumps in a CDF mean that the residents use their appliances around specific values and would be less willing for shifting their usage. In contrast, the houses with smoother profiles would be more open to altering their original appliance usage schedule, as their usage times are more uniformly distributed across a day.Next, we assign values to different CDF curve shapes, i.e., a function that translates a CDF curve into a numerical value. To achieve this, we use a well-known concept: Shannon entropy. Entropy is a measure of unpredictability of information content. In our case, when the appliance energy accumulates around certain intervals, the CDF curve has sharp jumps and becomes more predictable. Thus, the amount of information the CDF curve carries is low and this translates into low entropy. In contrast, a smoother CDF means that the appliance energy consumption is less predictable and thus it has a high entropy value.CDF for user’s appliance energy usageHistogram for entropy of user’s appliance energy usage Temperature: The temperature in Austin during a year, obtained through API. The temperature is higher from May to September, which leads to more energy consumption since people may use the air conditioning. Also, the temperature in summer fluctuates little compared to other months.Daily temperature of a yearHistogram for energy consumption in a year Utility ModelWhich appliance is more important to the user? Discrete Choice Model to estimate the value of energy. Build the binary choice model. $U_{yes} = \\beta_{0}+\\beta_{energy} x_{energy} + \\beta_{price} x_{price} + \\beta_{entropy} x_{entropy} + \\beta_{temperature} x_{temperature}$ $U_{no} = 0$ Estimate the parameters using Maximum Likelihood: $L* = \\prod_{j=1}^{J} \\prod_{i=1}^{I} P_{j}(i)y_{i,j}$ $\\hat{\\beta} = \\arg\\max_{\\beta} \\ln L*(\\beta_{e},\\beta_{p},\\beta_{r},\\beta_{t})$ Willingness to pay. coefficient of energy consumption/coefficient of energy price. $WTP = \\frac{\\partial price}{\\partial energy} = \\frac{\\partial U/ \\partial energy}{\\partial U/ \\partial price} = \\frac{\\beta_{energy}}{\\beta_{price}}$ Value of energy. willingness to pay * maximum energy consumption For certain appliances, how does the utility increase with the energy consumption? Quadratic Utility Function $U = ax(b-x)$. Rewrite as: $U = a’* (4/b^{2}) * x(b-x)$ Scaler of the utility $a$: willness to pay for marginal increase in utility. Maximum energy consumption $b$: maximum energy consumption in past week. ResultsIn this section, we first illustrate the estimation of the coefficients for the discrete choice model, and then we visualize the utility parameters of different users. Choice ModelFrom the perspective of value, increases in entropy and temperature lead to a higher probability of using the appliance. Increases in consumption and electricity price lead to a lower probability of using the appliance. From the perspective of significance, the entropy and electricity price are significant while the consumption and temperature are not significant. variable coef std err z P&amp;gt;|z| [0.025 0.975] intersection 0.3249 0.596 0.545 0.586 -0.844 1.494 entropy 0.5904 0.236 2.503 0.012 0.128 1.053 consumption, units:kWh -2.6819 1.395 -1.922 0.055 -5.416 0.052 electricity price, units:$/kWh -12.6955 5.100 -2.489 0.013 -22.692 -2.699 temperature, units:C 0.0169 0.016 1.027 0.305 -0.015 0.049 Utility ModelThe most important parameter in the utility model is the $a’$, which is also the willingness to pay. From the perspective of the mean value, the WTP is around 1 $/kWh, which makes sense. From the perspective of variance, the value is not very big for most appliances, except microwaves.Willingness to pay for all users’ applianceConclusionWe have policy design insights from a qualitative perspective and a quantitative perspective. QualitativeWhen designing the policy, we should consider the usage pattern of users (entropy and consumption). However, it is not enough. In mechanism design, the baseline of demand response is hard to estimate, since sometimes users will manipulate their historical data to show a false baseline, so as to obtain more benefits from the program. In this case, by estimating the willingness to pay for each appliance, it will be harder for the users to manipulate. Quantitative With the utility function, the system operator can optimize the social welfare by plugging in the users’ utility values.

This IoT-enabled smart grid tackles challenges brought by renewable penetration in new ways: Accurate and real-time information allows for the application of artificial-intelligence-powered computation. We employ the deep learning framework and consider the problem of storage control facing uncertainties in renewable generation. We propose both model-based and model-free storage control frameworks to identify the value of information. For the first framework, opposing to most deep-learning-oriented research in the electricity sector, we use the one-shot load decomposition technique to encode structural information into the learning framework. The structural information refers to the fact that the one-shot load decomposition maintains the control strategy space. Based on this structural information, we develop the storage control policy by utilizing a deep learning framework for price and renewable prediction, which is the basis of our deep-learning-enabled storage control. For the model-free framework, we regard historical price and demand data as input and directly output the control actions. For each model, we further establish theoretical analysis on how the uncertainties in price and renewables influence the cost.

To improve the efficiency of the ride-hailing platform, as well as to maintain fairness between different types of passengers, we study three variations of carpool service policies. We then provide practical guidelines on the trade-off between efficiency and fairness to assist the online platform designers.

Most existing markets employ the double auction to organize the markets: the independent system operator collects the bidding information from both the supply sides and solves the Walrasian equilibrium to conduct dispatch. Market manipulation arises when market players strategically bid their information. Hence to contain the manipulation, one promising solution is to design the double auction mechanism to induce truthful bidding. In this work, we customize four double auction mechanisms (Walrasian equilibrium Mechanism, VCG mechanism, MUDA (Lottery) mechanism, and MUDA (VCG) mechanism) for the electricity market.
